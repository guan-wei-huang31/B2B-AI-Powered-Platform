# B2B AI-Powered Product Retrieval Platform

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered B2B digital platform designed to streamline product discovery and sourcing across the agricultural and food manufacturing industries. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with vector embeddings generated by Google Gemini, the system enables intelligent and context-aware product search. The platform bridges the gap between farmers, processors, and manufacturers, allowing users to retrieve relevant products based on semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching.
